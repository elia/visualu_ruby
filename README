This is a fork of the visualuruby project http://www.osk.3web.ne.jp/~nyasu/vruby/vrproject-e.html

Slightly behind on vrswin updates I think there's been one more since I forked the code.

Note: WINDOWS ONLY :)

The project is split into two parts:

the binary "backend" (vrswin)
and a front "wrapper" for it. (vruby)

To install it, it appears you'll need ruby 1.9 (use an older version for 1.8.x), then go into vrwsin/swin, ruby extconf.rb, make, make install

(how to install ruby 1.9 windows mingw: http://programming-gone-awry.blogspot.com/2009/05/ruby-19-one-click-installer.html)


for vruby, run vruby080229>ruby vrinstall.rb

see examples folder, and also http://www.osk.3web.ne.jp/~nyasu/vruby/vrproject-e.html#sss

Note:  For ruby 1.9 (the default), you'll want to have at most one thread for GUI stuffs and (possibly others for non GUI) to avoid potential deadlocks.
