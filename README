This is a fork of the visualuruby project http://www.osk.3web.ne.jp/~nyasu/vruby/vrproject-e.html

Note: WINDOWS ONLY :)

The release is split into two parts:
the binary "backend" (vrswin)
and a front "wrapper" for it. (vruby)


To install it, it appears you'll need ruby 1.9, then go into vrwsin/swin, ruby extconf.rb, make, make install

with ruby 1.8.6 you might be able to download previous version of vrswin and it will install.

for vruby, you'll need to copy that lib folder over by hand.
